                     CONTRIBUTING TO LTZVISOR
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contributions to the LTZVisor are always welcome; however, contributions 
to the LTZVisor will require to sign a contribution agreement, which 
states the exact rights TZVisor project (trademark of Sandro Pinto) 
receives from contributors planning to submit code to the LTZVisor.

In this way, it will be possible to redistribute all contributions
under the open source license, while enabling the participation  of 
commercial users in the TZVisor project development. We strongly
believe this strategy will result in a stronger commitment and  
diffusion of LTZVisor in the embedded systems industry. 

Details of the contribution agreement will be disclosed in a few weeks. 
Contributors are invited to kindly postpone their contributions till
the contribution agreement is set. 

If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us 
by dropping an email to info@tzvisor.org.
